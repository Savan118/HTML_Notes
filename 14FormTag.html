    <h2>Form in HTML</h2>
    <p>The <strong> &lt;form&gt; </strong> HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls
        for submitting
        information</p>
    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p><strong>accept</strong><br>Comma- separated content type the server accepts </p>
    <p><strong>accept-charset</strong><br>Space-separated character encodings the server accepts. The browser uses them
        in the order in which they are listed. The default value means the same encoding as the page. (In previous
        versions of HTML, character encodings could also be delimited by commas.) </p>
    <p><strong>autocapitalize </strong><br>A nonstandard attribute used by iOS Safari that controls how textual form
        elements should be automatically capitalized. autocapitalize attributes on a form elements override it on
        &lt;form&gt;. Possible values </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>none:</strong> no automatic capitalization</li>
        <li><strong>sentences (default):</strong> Capitalize the first letter of each sentences. </li>
        <li><strong>words:</strong> Capitalize the first letter of each word</li>
        <li><strong>characters:</strong> Capitalize all characters - that is uppercase</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>autocomplete</strong><br>Indicates whether input elements can by default have their values automatically
        completed by the browser </p>
    <p><strong>name</strong><br>The name of the form. The value must not be the empty string, and must be unique among
        the form elements in the forms collection that it is in, if any. </p>
    <p><strong>rel</strong><br>Controls the annotations and what kinds of links the form creates. Annotations include
        external, nofollow, opener, noopener, and noreferrer. Link types include help, prev, next, search, and license.
        The rel value is a space-separated list of these enumerated values. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Attributes for form submission</h3>
    <p><strong>action</strong><br>The URL that processes the form submission. This value can be overridden by a
        formaction attribute on a < button>, < input type="submit">, or < input type="image"> element. This attribute is
                    ignored when method="dialog" is set. </p>
    <p><strong>enctype</strong><br> If the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME type of the form
        submission. Possible values:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value.</li>
        <li>multipart/form-data: Use this if the form contains < input> elements with type=file.</li>
        <li>text/plain: Useful for debugging purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>method</strong><br> The method is submit to form with. there are tow types of methods are avaialble </p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>GET:</li><br>




        GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
        <p>GET method is faster than POST.</p>
        <p>GET method is less secure than POST</p>
        <p>Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs</p>
        <p>The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)</p>
        <p> Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)</p>
        <p> Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result</p>
        <li>POST: </li><br>
        <p>Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown in URL)</p>
        <p>Has no size limitations</p>
        <p>Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked</p>
        <p>Slower than GET method</p>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>novalidate</strong><br>This Boolean attribute indicates that the form shouldn't be validated when
        submitted. If this attribute is not set (and therefore the form is validated), it can be overridden by a
        formnovalidate attribute on a < button>, < input type="submit">, or < input type="image"> element belonging to
                    the
                    form. </p>
    <p><strong>target</strong><br>Indicates where to display the response after submitting the form. It is a
        name/keyword for a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or iframe). The following keywords have special
        meanings:
    <ol type="1">

        <li>_self (default): Load into the same browsing context as the current one.</li>
        <li>_blank: Load into a new unnamed browsing context. This provides the same behavior as setting rel="noopener"
            which does not set window.opener.</li>
        <li>_parent: Load into the parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves the same as _self.
        </li>
        <li>_top: Load into the top-level browsing context (i.e., the browsing context that is an ancestor of the
            current
            one and has no parent). If no parent, behaves the same as _self.</li>
        </p>
    </ol>
